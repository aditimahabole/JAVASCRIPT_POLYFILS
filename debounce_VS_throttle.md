## 1.  Debouncing

   - Debouncing ensures that a function is only executed after a certain amount of time has passed since the last time the event was triggered.
   - It's useful when you want to delay the execution of a function until after the user has stopped performing the action that triggers it. For example, debouncing can be used to delay a search function until the user has finished typing in a search input.

## 2. Throttling

   - Throttling limits the rate at which a function is called to a specified interval, regardless of how many times the event that triggers it occurs.
   - It's useful when you want to ensure that a function is not called more frequently than a certain rate. For example, throttling can be used to limit the frequency of scroll events or mousemove events.
